## Basics
- React is a UI Library
- It has unidirectional data flow i.e. state usually lives in one component (App.js) and trickles down as props
- It is declarative
- It uses a component architecture

## Developing apps
- Decide on components
- Decide the state and where it lives i.e. place state in the appropriate component
- What changes when state changes i.e. what part of the Virtual DOM is rendered when state changes
